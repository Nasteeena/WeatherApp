This app is used for showing the Weather Forecast based on the found city.

It uses the following API: <a href='https://openweathermap.org/'>open weather</a>

## Interface

There are three main tabs
<ul>
    <li>Now: shows the current city and its forecast with the button heart, which adds the city to the city list</li>
    <li>Details: shows more detailed forecast on the current city</li>

</ul>
